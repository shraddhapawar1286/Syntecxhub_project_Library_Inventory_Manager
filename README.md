# Syntecxhub_project_Library_Inventory_Manager
This Python project is used to manage library books. It allows adding, searching, issuing, and returning books. The program uses Book and Library classes (OOP concept). Book data is stored in a JSON file for permanent saving. It also generates simple reports like total and issued books.
The Library Book Inventory Manager is a Python-based application used to manage library books efficiently. This project allows users to add new books, search books by title or author, and perform issue and return operations.
The program uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts by creating two main classes:
Book class – stores details like book ID, title, author, and status.
Library class – manages all book operations.
It uses lists and dictionaries (HashMap-like structure) for quick searching and data management. The program also stores book records in a JSON file, so the data is saved permanently and reloaded when the program starts again.
Additionally, the system can generate simple reports such as:
Total number of books
Number of issued books
Available books count
This project demonstrates:
Basic OOP concepts (classes, objects, methods)
File handling (JSON)
Data structures (lists and dictionaries)
Searching and reporting features
